# Apple MacOS 26 Tahoe De-Enshittifier 2026 script

It nukes the background "intelligence" services, stops the OS from trying to guess your typing, and kills UI animations that make Tahoe feel like a lagging toy.

This is for those of us who have to use this crap piece of legacy OS. There is no reason in 2026 to use Mac OSX anymore. Most of the BSD tools are outdated (rsync et al), and many of us have been using [homebrew](https://brew.sh) for years. Stop supporting Apple and install [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/).

For everyone else: find the "restore.sh" script here that makes your MacOS "pad" a computer again.
